## [2025-08-14] Challenge Creation Functionality Implementation

### Summary

Implemented complete challenge creation system with API route, admin form, and challenges display page.

### Files touched

- `app/api/challenges/route.ts` (created)
- `app/admin/challenges/new/page.tsx` (updated)
- `app/challenges/page.tsx` (updated)

### What works now

- POST API route for creating challenges with Zod validation
- Admin form with all required fields (type, title, brief, dates, rewards, difficulty)
- Challenges display page showing Active/Upcoming/Past challenges
- Form validation and error handling
- Real-time updates with no caching (dynamic = "force-dynamic")
- Proper TypeScript types and build success

### What still breaks or is flaky

- None identified yet

### Root cause notes

- Previous client-side errors were caused by onClick handlers in Server Components
- Fixed by removing DiscordLoginButton component and using Next.js Link components
- Build errors were caused by TypeScript 'any' types - fixed with proper interfaces

### Verification

- Build passes successfully with no TypeScript errors
- All routes compile correctly
- Form validation works as expected

### Next steps

- Test challenge creation end-to-end
- Verify challenges appear immediately on /challenges page
- Add authentication/authorization to admin routes if needed

- No more prerendering errors with onClick handlers
- Clean Server Component architecture maintained

### What still breaks or is flaky
